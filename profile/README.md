# InertiaCore

Welcome to the **InertiaCore** GitHub organization â€” the home for using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/file-uploads) with [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet).

[InertiaCore](https://github.com/kapi2289/InertiaCore) allows developers to build modern, single-page applications using classic server-side routing and controllers in ASP.NET Core. It brings together the simplicity of server-driven apps with the rich interactivity of modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte.

## What is InertiaCore?

InertiaCore provides a lightweight middleware and tooling layer that allows ASP.NET Core to serve Inertia.js-powered frontends without the complexity of building and maintaining a separate API. With InertiaCore, you write your backend logic using familiar MVC or minimal API patterns, and your frontend using your preferred JavaScript framework.

Key features:

- Tight integration with ASP.NET Core MVC and endpoints
- Zero client-side routing setup
- Server-side redirects and validation flow
- Shared props between server and client
- SSR-friendly
